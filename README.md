# joeis-lite
Subset of jOEIS for program generation and testing

This repository is a stripped-down copy of Sean Irving's https://github.com/archmageirvine/joeis. The test classes and all implemented sequences in the directories src/irvine/oeis/a* are removed in order to reduce compile time and jar size.

joeis-lite/internal/fischer contains procedures for the generation of groups of sequences.

# joeis-alt
Alternative Java implementations of OEIS sequences. 

This repository stores copies of source files from Sean Irvine's jOEIS project (cf. https://github.com/archmageirvine/joeis) such that two different implementations can be compared. A typical case is a "native" algorithm implementation in jOEIS and a linear recurrence or ordinary generating function in joeis-alt. 

The alternative implementations are usually generated in the subproject https://github.com/gfis/joeis-lite.

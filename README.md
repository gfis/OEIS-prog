# OEIS-prog
Programs from the Online Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences (https://oeis.org) with a uniform calling interface.

This repository stores copies of source files from the OEIS such that they can be called by the common interface of Sean Irvine's jOEIS project (cf. https://github.com/archmageirvine/joeis). It is related to project https://github.com/gfis/joeis-lite.
